WARRANT CANARY
***************

No warrants have ever been served to Bantu Bitcoin (e.g. to hand out private signing keys, or to introduce backdoors to any project in which the podcast is involved, in so far as the podcast knows), nor have any searches or seizures taken place of the podcast's own space.

Bantu Bitcoin has not received:

 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a broad order for user metadata
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a broad order for user data
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a targeted order for user data
 * A gag order preventing the disclosure of a targeted order for user metadata

Bantu Bitcoin has never received a legal order enforceable in their jurisdiction for user data.

Bantu Bitcoin has never received a legal order enforceable in their jurisdiction for any broad class of users.

Bantu Bitcoin has never received a gag order preventing disclosure of any broad order.

A gag order refers to any legal order enforceable in Bantu Bitcoin's jurisdiction preventing disclosure of:
 * A request or order for user information
 * A request or order for investigative assistance
 * A request or order for technical assistance
 * Any other request, order, demand, or information of any type


****************
DEADLINE UPDATE
****************

The next canary statement is planned to be published within 3 months, before 20, Jul. 2025.

*Special note should be taken if no new canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements change without plausible explanation.*

**************
PROOF OF DATE
**************

PROOF OF DATE is currently best demonstrated utilizing a combination of two(2) tools:

(1) Printing a very recent Bitcoin block hash demonstrates that this canary could not have been created PRIOR to the date and time of the Bitcoin block height stated (3 blocks back [~30 minutes] to protect against likelihood of block reorganization), and

(2) Verifying the hash of this canary.txt file timestamped on https://OpenTimestamps.org and included in the Bitcoin blockchain demonstrates that this canary could not have been created AFTER the date and time stated.

Thus, a narrow window between these two results is the only plausible date and time for the creation and timestamped signature of this canary.

(1) A very recent Bitcoin block hash:
0000000000000000000015993a658854eb74e01148b21a044c5199ebebf506a9

Block: 893233

(You can easily view evidence of this Bitcoin block hash at a website like:
https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000015993a658854eb74e01148b21a044c5199ebebf506a9)

(2) Next, verify the matching hashes of the following files on https://OpenTimestamps.org and that it is included in a Bitcoin block sufficiently close in date and time to Block 893233 from Step 1.

Download the two files at:
* https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/Bantu-Bitcoin/canary.txt.ots
* https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/Bantu-Bitcoin/canary.txt

Then at https://OpenTimestamps.org, first drag (or otherwise, 'upload') the .txt.ots proof file into the STAMP & VERIFY box, followed by the .txt stamped file into the box below it.

If all checks out, the files will both display a matching hash and the Bitcoin block height and time in which this hash was included.

Compare this Bitcoin block height and time to Block 893233. Each difference in block height represents the passage of ~10 minutes.


********************
DISCLAIMERS & NOTES
********************

(1) No data within any files are actually uploaded to the servers at https://OpenTimestamps.org in the process of creating or verifying this timestamp. Only a SHA256 hash function occurs within the privacy of one's browser. In the timestamp creation process, only the hash of the file is included among many others in a Merkle tree of a subsequent Bitcoin block.

(2) This scheme is not infallible. Although signing this declaration makes it difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force—or other means like blackmail or compromise of the signer's laptop(s), for example—to coerce one to produce false declarations.

(3) This declaration is merely a best effort and provided without any guarantees, warranty, and is not legally binding in any way to anyone. No signer should ever be held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.

(4) Failure to update this canary does not necessarily mean Bantu Bitcoin has received a gag order; nor is not updating it—or omitting anything—an attempt to communicate anything to anyone. Frankly, it's also entirely plausible that 5atoshiNakamoto could have become otherwise incapacitated or lazy with his or her systems management of this website, leaving this canary to expire, but let's hope not. Have you asked him or her? This canary serves only to periodically confirm certain facts as long as they are presently true.

(5) Compromise of the associated Github account, 5atoshiNakamoto, or Bantu Bitcoin's PGP private key remains always a remote possibility.

(6) Doing the best we can.
