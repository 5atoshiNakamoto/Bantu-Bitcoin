# Warrant Canaries

## Final

This has been the final canary specific to the Bantu Bitcoin repository. As detailed within, the next canary statement is planned to be signed and published within 6 months, before 20, Jan. 2026 by 5atoshiNakamoto and can be found at [https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary](https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canary) along with all future canaries relevant to Bantu Bitcoin, unless and until otherwise noted. 

*Special note should be taken if no new canary gets published by that time, or if the list of statements change without plausible explanation.*

This final canary has been signed by both Bantu Bitcoin (primary) and 5atoshiNakamoto. A similar canary, a "cross-over" canary–if you will–has been signed this date (2025-07-20) by 5atoshiNakamoto (primary) and Bantu Bitcoin, which appears below and at [https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canaries](https://5atoshiNakamoto.github.io/canaries).
